In this series, we will build a functional Chip-8 emulator in Rust. By the end
of this series, you will learn the fundamentals of emulation and gain a deeper
understanding of computer architecture.

To follow the code written in this series, you should have beginner to
intermediate level proficiency in Rust. If not, you are encouraged to follow the
concepts from this series and implement them in your favorite programming
language.

But, wait, what is a Chip-8?

It is a simple, interpreted, programming language.
It was designed in the 1970s, for the ease of writing small programs and games
on different microcomputers of the time. Nowadays, it is more used as an
educational tool for learning about emulation, low-level programming, and
computer architecture due to it's simple design.


## Building an Emulator

An emulator is a piece of hardware or software which mimics another computer
system. This means, by implementing our own Chip-8 emulator, we will be able to
run software and games written for Chip-8 on this emulator.

The first step to writing an emulator is finding technical reference for it. For
Chip-8, there are a lot out there, but I would recommend the following:

- [CHIP-8 Virtual Machine
  Specification](https://tonisagrista.com/blog/2021/chip8-spec/)
- [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference
  v1.0](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
- [Guide to making a CHIP-8
  emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/)


These detail out all the specifications that we are going to implement for our
emulator implementation.


## Structuring the Emulator

Let's sketch out a basic layout for our emulator project.

We'll start by creating a Rust binary project `chip8-emulator`. We'll place each
component into it's own module to make it easier to understand the system. We'll
start by creating the `emulator` module in main:

```rust {1-2} title="main.rs"
mod emulator;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

For the contents of emulator, we will just create an empty `Emulator` struct,
which we will populate in the subsequent steps.

```rust title="emulator.rs"
pub struct Emulator {}
```


### Registers

Chip-8 has 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers, named `V0` to `VF`. Additionally,
there is a 16-bit register called `I`, which is used to store memory addresses.
There is also a 16-bit program counter `PC`, not accessible from Chip-8
programs, used to store the currently executing address.

We can add these fields directly to our `Emulator` struct.
 
```rust {2-4} title="emulator.rs"
pub struct Emulator {
    registers: [u8; 16],  // 16 8-bit registers
    index: u16,           // 16-bit index register
    program_counter: u16, // 16-bit program counter
}
```


### Memory

The Chip-8 system has a total of 4 kB (4096 bytes) of Random Access Memory. The
first 512 bytes (`0x000` to `0x1FF`) are reserved for the interpreter, and the
remaining 3584 bytes (`0x200` to `0xFFF`) are used for user programs and data
storage.

```diagram
+-------------------+-- 0x000 (0)               
|                   |   Start of Chip-8 RAM     
|     Reserved      |                           
|                   |                           
+-------------------+-- 0x200 (512)             
|                   |   Start of Chip-8 programs
|   User Programs   |                           
|     and Data      |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
|                   |                           
+-------------------+-- 0xFFF (4095)            
                        End of Chip-8 RAM       
```

We will create a separate `memory` module

```rust {2} title="main.rs"
mod emulator;
mod memory;
```

In this module, we will create a `Memory` struct. This will help up colocate the stored
memory and it's behavior.

```rust title="memory.rs"
const MEMORY_SIZE: usize = 0x1000; // 4096

pub struct Memory {
    storage: [u8; MEMORY_SIZE], // 4kb
}
```


### Stack

The stack is a 16-bit LIFO array of length 16. This is used to store the return
addresses for returning out of subroutines.

Similar to the previous steps, we'll create a `stack` module and create a
`Stack` struct for this.

```rust title="stack.rs"
const STACK_SIZE: usize = 0x10; // 16

pub struct Stack {
    pointer: usize,
    values: [u16; STACK_SIZE], // 16 16-bit values
}
```


### Timers

Chip-8 has two timers: a delay timer and a sound timer. Both timers count down
at 60Hz when set to a non-zero value. The delay timer is used for timing events,
while the sound timer beeps until it reaches zero.

We'll create a module for `timer`, and implement the `Timer` struct.

```rust title="timer.rs"
pub struct Timer {
    value: u8,
}
```


### Keypad

CHIP-8 implementations used a keypad with 16 keys, labeled with the hexadecimals
0 to F in the following layout:

```diagram
[1][2][3][C]
[4][5][6][D]
[7][8][9][E]
[A][0][B][F]
```

Each individual key can be polled if it is in pressed state or not. We can store
this into a boolean array.

```rust title="keypad.rs"
pub struct Keypad {
    keys: [bool; 16],
}
```


### Display

The Chip-8 has a 64x32-pixel monochrome display with this format:

```diagram
[0,0]                      [63,0]
+-------------------------------+
|                               |
|                               |
|         64x32 DISPLAY         |
|                               |
|                               |
+-------------------------------+
[0,31]                    [63,31]
```

We can represent this as single array of 64 * 32 booleans to indicate if the
pixel is on or off.

```rust title="display.rs"
const DISPLAY_WIDTH: usize = 64;
const DISPLAY_HEIGHT: usize = 32;
const DISPLAY_PIXELS: usize = DISPLAY_WIDTH * DISPLAY_HEIGHT;

pub struct Display {
    buffer: [bool; DISPLAY_PIXELS],
}
```


### Putting the pieces together

Our final `main.rs` should look like:

```rust title="main.rs"
mod display;
mod emulator;
mod keypad;
mod memory;
mod stack;
mod timer;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Adding all the components into the emulator, we get:

```rust {1-6,11-16} title="emulator.rs"
use crate::display::Display;
use crate::keypad::Keypad;
use crate::memory::Memory;
use crate::stack::Stack;
use crate::timer::Timer;

pub struct Emulator {
    registers: [u8; 16],  // 16 8-bit registers
    index: u16,           // 16-bit index register
    program_counter: u16, // 16-bit program counter
    memory: Memory,
    stack: Stack,
    delay_timer: Timer,
    sound_timer: Timer,
    keypad: Keypad,
    display: Display,
}
```


## Wrapping Up

In this post, we structured our Chip-8 emulator project and defined its main
components: `Emulator`, `Display`, `Keypad`, `Memory`, `Stack`, and `Timer`.

In the next part of this series, we'll dive into implementing the emulation
cycle for Chip-8, ie, mimicking the execution of a Chip-8 program. Understanding
and implementing this will be crucial as this defines how the emulator processes
and executes Chip-8 programs.
