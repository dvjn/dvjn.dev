This is the second part of the series on building a Chip-8 emulator in Rust. In
the previous post, [Build a Chip-8 Emulator in Rust - Part 1 - Emulator
Design](./chip-8-emulator-in-rust-part-one), we explored the components of our
emulator, defining data structures for registers, memory, display, and other
essential parts. Now, we'll delve into the core functionality of starting and
running the emulator.


## Initializing the Emulator

Let's initialize the emulator by implementing a `new` function. When
initializing the emulator, all values are expected to be 0 except for the
program counter, which should start at `0x200` (remember, the first 512 bytes of
memory are reserved for the interpreter).

```rust title="emulator.rs"
impl Emulator {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            registers: [0; 16],
            index: 0,
            program_counter: 0x200,
            memory: Memory::new(),
            stack: Stack::new(),
            delay_timer: Timer::new(),
            sound_timer: Timer::new(),
            keypad: Keypad::new(),
            display: Display::new(),
        }
    }
}
```

Initializing most components with zero values is straightforward. However, the
memory requires additional setup, which we'll explore next.


### Initializing the Memory

Let's start by creating an empty memory buffer:

```rust title="memory.rs"
impl Memory {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut storage = [0; MEMORY_SIZE];
        Self { storage }
    }
}
```


### Adding Font Sprites

As explained in part one of the series, the memory has first 512 bytes reserved
for the interpreter. In this reserved section, programs generally expect font
sprites for hexadecimal digits 0 through F at `0x000` address.

But, what is a sprite? and how is it stored in memory?

Chip-8 draws graphics on screen through the use of sprites. Each sprite consists
of 8-bit bytes, where each bit corresponds to a horizontal pixel; sprites are
between 1 and 15 bytes tall. Let's visualize this.

Say you wanted to draw the digit 6 on the screen:

```sprite
■■■■    
■   
■■■■
■  ■
■■■■
```

You will create a sprite: `0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0`.

This sprite might not make much sense in it's hexadecimal form, but let's
convert it to binary and look at it again:

```diagram "1"
0xF0 => 11110000
0x80 => 10000000
0xF0 => 11110000
0x90 => 10010000
0xF0 => 11110000
```

From this representation we can understand how each bit represents a pixel on
the display. So when the user program calls the draw command with this sprite,
the display pixel is flipped if the bit is set in the sprite. This is how a
sprite is rendered in Chip-8.

So now we understand what sprites are and how they work, we can add all the
required sprites to our code:

```rust {2-19} title="memory.rs"
const MEMORY_SIZE: usize = 0x1000; // 4096
const FONT_SPRITES: [u8; 5 * 16] = [
    0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, // 0
    0x20, 0x60, 0x20, 0x20, 0x70, // 1
    0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, // 2
    0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 3
    0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x10, 0x10, // 4
    0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 5
    0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, // 6
    0xF0, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x40, // 7
    0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, // 8
    0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 9
    0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, // A
    0xE0, 0x90, 0xE0, 0x90, 0xE0, // B
    0xF0, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0xF0, // c
    0xE0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xE0, // D
    0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, // E
    0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x80, 0x80, // F
];
```

Let's put these sprites at `0x000` in the memory.

```rust {4} title="memory.rs"
impl Memory {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut storage = [0; MEMORY_SIZE];
        storage[0x000..FONT_SPRITES.len()].copy_from_slice(&FONT_SPRITES);
        Self { storage }
    }
}
```

### Loading the ROM

Another thing the memory is initialized with is the user program, often referred
to as a ROM. This is stored at the address `0x200`. We can take the ROM as input
during emulator creation.

Let's add this to our code:

```rust {2,5} title="memory.rs"
impl Memory {
    pub fn new(rom: &[u8]) -> Self {
        let mut storage = [0; MEMORY_SIZE];
        storage[0x000..FONT_SPRITES.len()].copy_from_slice(&FONT_SPRITES);
        storage[0x200..(0x200 + rom.len())].copy_from_slice(rom);
        Self { storage }
    }
}
```

We'll have take the rom as an input for our emulator too and pass it to the
memory.

```rust {2,7} title="emulator.rs"
impl Emulator {
    pub fn new(rom: &[u8]) -> Self {
        Self {
            registers: [0; 16],
            index: 0,
            program_counter: 0x200,
            memory: Memory::new(rom),
            stack: Stack::new(),
            delay_timer: Timer::new(),
            sound_timer: Timer::new(),
            keypad: Keypad::new(),
            display: Display::new(),
        }
    }
}
```

Memory is now initialized. The other components can all be initialized with zero
values, without needing any additional logic. Implementing those is left as an
exercise to the reader.


## Emulation Loop

Let's start with the emulation loop, the code that will drive the emulator.


### Starting the Emulator

We'll create a new emulator by first loading a Chip-8 ROM. We can take the path
of the ROM file as a command-line argument for the program and pass it to out
emulator.

```rust {1-5,7-10} title="main.rs"
use std::env::args;
use std::fs::read;

use crate::emulator::Emulator;

fn main() {
    let rom_path = args().skip(1).next().expect("rom path");
    let rom = read(rom_path).expect("rom file");

    let mut emulator = Emulator::new(&rom);
}
```

### Running the Emulation Cycle

The emulation cycle needs 2 timed components, one is the CPU and second is the
timers. The timers count down at a rate of 60Hz, ie, 60 times a second. The CPU
is not as straightforward, as the execution speed of a Chip-8 CPU is not
strictly documented and varies from implementation to implementation, varying
from 500Hz to 1MHz. For our implementation, we can run the emulator at an
approximate speed of 540 instructions per second (540 Hz).

To implement this, we can start with a loop that runs 60 times a second. We can
approximately emulate this by running a sleep for `1_000_000_000/60` nanoseconds
in every iteration.

```rust {3-4,13-16} title="main.rs"
use std::env::args;
use std::fs::read;
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

use crate::emulator::Emulator;

fn main() {
    let rom_path = std::env::args().skip(1).next().expect("rom path");
    let rom = std::fs::read(rom_path).expect("open rom file");

    let mut emulator = Emulator::new(&rom);

    loop {
        sleep(Duration::new(0, 1_000_000_000u32 / 60));
    }
}
```

### Executing CPU Instructions

Since we have to run 540 CPU instructions every second. If we execute 9
instructions in every iteration, we can achieve approximately 9x60=540
instructions per second.

```rust {8-10} title="main.rs"
fn main() {
    let rom_path = std::env::args().skip(1).next().expect("rom path");
    let rom = std::fs::read(rom_path).expect("open rom file");

    let mut emulator = Emulator::new(&rom);

    loop {
        for _ in 0..9 {
            emulator.run_cycle();
        }

        sleep(Duration::new(0, 1_000_000_000u32 / 60));
    }
}
```

For now we'll just implement an empty `run_cycle` associated function for
Emulator, which we will populate with logic later.

```rust {3-4} title="emulator.rs"
impl Emulator {
    // ... other code ...

    pub fn run_cycle(&mut self) {}
}
```

### Decrementing Timers

We also have to decrement the sound and delay timers at 60Hz, ie, once per
iteration of this loop.

```rust {12-13} title="main.rs"
fn main() {
    let rom_path = std::env::args().skip(1).next().expect("rom path");
    let rom = std::fs::read(rom_path).expect("open rom file");

    let mut emulator = Emulator::new(&rom);

    loop {
        for _ in 0..9 {
            emulator.run_cycle();
        }

        emulator.decrement_timers();

        sleep(Duration::new(0, 1_000_000_000u32 / 60));
    }
}
```

We will implement this function in the `Emulator` struct:

```rust {3-7} title="emulator.rs"
impl Emulator {
    // ... other code ...

    pub fn decrement_timers(&mut self) {
        self.sound_timer.decrement();
        self.delay_timer.decrement();
    }
}
```

And also implement the decrement function for the `Timer` struct:

```rust title="timer.rs"
impl Timer {
    // ... other code ...

    pub fn decrement(&mut self) {
        if self.value > 0 {
            self.value -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Wrapping Up

In this part of the series, we laid the groundwork for our Chip-8 emulator by
initializing its core components and setting up the emulation loop. We
implemented loading font sprites into memory, handling ROM loading, and managing
the emulation cycle, ensuring the CPU runs at an appropriate speed while
maintaining timings for the delay and sound timers.

In the next part, we'll dive deeper into the execution of Chip-8 instructions,
decoding and handling various opcodes, and integrating SDL2 to manage graphics,
input, and sound. With these additions, we'll bring our emulator closer to
running actual Chip-8 programs and interacting with users. Stay tuned!
